"""
Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a rotational cipher to obfuscate a message

Write a program that generates the cipher text according to a given plaintext and number of rotations

The plaintext is a string containing 0 or many characters, and the number of rotations is a positive integer

We will preserve the case sensitivity of the plaintext and spaces within it

Examples

If the plaintext is "Hello world", positions is 6
The encrypted text is "Nkrru cuxrj"

If the plaintext is "zebra", positions is 2
The encrypted text is "bgdtc"

def main():
    print(encrypt_text("zebra", 2))
