Write a program to count the number of square free numbers within a lower and upper range (both inclusive)

For example if the range is 1 to 10
1 is a square-free integer
2 is a square-free integer
3 is a square-free integer
4 is NOT a square-free integer (divisible by 4)
5 is a square-free integer
6 is a square-free integer
7 is a square-free integer
8 is NOT a square-free integer (divisible by 4)
9 is NOT a square-free integer (divisible by 9)
10 is a square-free integer
This range has 7 square free numbers in total
