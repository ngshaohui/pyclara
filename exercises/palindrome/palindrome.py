"""
A palindrome is a string which is read the same forwards and backwards

Write a program that checks if a string is a palindrome

The input string is guaranteed to be made of a single word, entirely in lowercase characters, and contain at least 1 character.

Examples

If the string is "abba"
The string is a palindrome

If the string is "no"
The string is not a palindrome

If the string is "cisabbasic"
The string is a palindrome
