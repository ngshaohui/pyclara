# Version control

Having version control is effective for working with multiple iterations of a particular project.

We can also work on different copies of the same thing, and be able to synchronise them on the same timeline.

This allows multiple people to work on the same thing simultaneously (or the same person), on different machines.

## Popular version control tools

- Dropbox
- Google Docs
- git
- mercurial

Commercial version control tools are often also offered as "cloud" applications, which handle both version control and storage.

On the other hand, tools like `git` and `mercurial` are both open source tools favoured by programmers.

Compared to commercial tools, they often only have very basic functionality, needing some degree of manual interaction and troubleshooting.

We will only be looking at `git` in this chapter.

## `git`

`git` is by far the most popular version control tool used by programmers.

### Version control (TODO)

While it is meant for version controlling code in general, it can be used for almost all types of data by all intents and purposes.

### Remote storage (TODO)

### `git` vs Github?

Services such as Github, Gitlab, Gitbucket provide an interactive way to store view the data we have version controlled using `git`.

They both have underlying mechanisms that rely on `git` to function.

The user is also required to use `git` to function with these services.
