# Types of feedback

This is based off the 3 main categories we used for marking code back in CS1010

The subcategories are to try to break down and list some common occurrences

## Correctness

### Logic error

- there algorithm used is incorrect
- output is correct for the test cases, but will be incorrect for edge cases
- usage of uninitialised variables

### Syntax error

- code has been written incorrectly and can not be executed properly
- code has not been indented correctly, resulting in errors

## Style

### Formatting

- code has inconsistent spacing

### Code grouping

- irrelevant logic was grouped together in the same codeblock
- similar logic was not grouped together in the same codeblock

### Missing comments

- logic used in an algorithm is unclear, need comments to explain it

### Redundant comments

- comments written is unnecessary as it does not explain the logic used
- logic is too straightforward to necessitate comments

### Line too long

- code written on this line should be split into multiple lines

## Design

### Convoluted logic

- algorithm used is correct, but could be simplified

### Redundant code

- redundant lines of code
- unused to repeated imports

### Naming

- name for the variable or function is undescriptive
- name for the variable or function is different from what is does
- typo in name
